## About Me

Normally I don't do this...

???

Lots of faces I don't recognise so I'm sure lots of people that don't recognise me either...

--

* Senior Dev and Head of Processing at PayProp

???

Since 10 years, I'll get into that shortly

--

* Developer for 20 years

???

Worked with various languages, but most often Perl

Only worked for three companies in that time

So have seen tech stacks grow and change

--

* CPAN contributor: [LEEJO](https://metacpan.org/author/LEEJO)

???

--

* London and Swiss Perl Workshop organiser

???

Come and talk to me

--

* A regular [speaker](https://leejo.github.io/code/) at other Perl workshops and conferences

???

Usually helping out with recordings of talks

--

* An occasional [blogger](https://leejo.github.io/tags/perl/) on Perl

???

Prefer to write longer form articles than short technical posts

--

* Run the [Perl Events](https://www.instagram.com/perl_events/) Instagram account

???

That's pretty much the limit of my social media interaction however

--

* A FOSDEM newbie!

???

Our work event has always clashed, but not this year
